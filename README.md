### 🚀 **Recent Projects**

- **`P² Market - AI-Powered Perpetual Prediction Market`**

  Introduced and built the first AI-powered perpetual prediction market, enabling users to trade the probability of real-world events — from elections to sports and culture — with leverage and dynamic funding rates. Unlike traditional betting platforms, P² Market allows users to speculate on the market's collective belief, powered by an AI-driven risk engine and verified on-chain oracles. The platform creates a new dimension of probability trading where every position reflects market consensus and real-time risk dynamics.

- **`Ethereum Bundler using Flashbots MEV-Share`**

  Developed an Ethereum transaction bundling system that leverages Flashbots MEV-Share to atomically execute token deployment and immediate purchase transactions. The system deploys token contracts with customizable parameters and executes token purchases in the same block, ensuring atomic execution through Flashbots MEV-Share bundling. Built using the @flashbots/mev-share-client library with configurable environment variables for flexible deployment and execution parameters.

- **`Verifiable Trading Strategy Marketplace on BNB`**

  Allow strategy authors to publish verifiable backtests and risk metrics (drawdown, Sharpe, worst case) that users can check onchain before running capital. Run strategy simulation off-chain in Pico zkVM; produce proof that the reported PnL came from running X on authentic historical blocks. Verify before users deposit.

- **`Perpetual DEX on Cardano with ADA-Based Proxy Collateral`**

  Built a perpetual decentralized exchange (DEX) on Cardano that enables trading with ADA as the primary collateral asset. Leveraged the Orderly Network SDK for orderbook and matching infrastructure, which natively supports only EVM-based assets. To bridge this limitation, implemented a proxy-collateral mechanism that mirrors users’ underlying ADA balances as tradable margin within the EVM-compatible environment.

- **`Commercial AI Chatbot Integration`**

  Built a full-stack AI chatbot application integrating Azure AI services with a Flask RESTful API backend and a modern Next.js frontend. The Flask application provides secure, scalable endpoints for real-time chat interactions and comprehensive chat history management. Leveraged Azure's cloud infrastructure for AI-powered conversational capabilities, ensuring high availability and performance. The Next.js frontend delivers a responsive, user-friendly interface with seamless API integration for optimal user experience.
